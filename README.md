### Embedding Model
Using the **CLIP** model ðŸ¤— [openai/clip-vit-base-patch32](openai/clip-vit-base-patch32) to generate embedding vector for images, stored on a vector database, such as **Pinecone** to facilitate search capabilities.

- Fig: Pipeline diagram

With 4 classes, including **Airplane, Dog, Cat and Car**, there are around 120 images (30 each) in total. These images are stored in an **AWS S3** bucket. After generating embeddings for each image, these embeddings are stored on a **Pinecone** index with their respective **S3** links as metadata.

The vector embedding of the input image is generated and the relevant top-k embeddings are fetched from the **Pinecone** database. Once the results are obtained, the corresponding images are fetched from the **S3** bucket using the links stored as metadata.

## Getting started
1. Clone repository
2. Create virtual env and install dependencies
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv

   source venv/bin/activate # linux
   venv\Scripts\activate # windows

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Modify the `config.yaml` file and add the necessary fields like S3 bucket name, pinecone index name, etc. 
4. Run the application using
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
